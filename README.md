# Image Resizer (Python)

## Overview

This project is a simple Image Resizer utility built using Python and OpenCV.

It allows users to resize an image by entering a scaling percentage. The resized image is then saved as a new file.

The purpose of this project was to understand how image dimensions can be manipulated using OpenCV and how basic image processing works in Python.

## Features

- Resize image using percentage scaling
- Supports increasing or decreasing image size
- Saves resized image as a new file
- Simple command-line input

---

## Tech Stack

- Python
- OpenCV (cv2)

---

## How It Works

1. The script reads an image file.
2. The user enters a scaling percentage.
3. New width and height are calculated.
4. The image is resized using OpenCV.
5. The new image is saved as a separate file.

Example:
- Enter 80 → Image reduces by 20%
- Enter 120 → Image increases by 20%

---

## How to Run

Install OpenCV & Run the script. Enter the desired percentage when prompted.

---

## Learning Outcome

While building this project, I practiced:

- Reading and writing images using OpenCV
- Understanding image dimensions and scaling
- Performing basic image processing operations
- Handling user input in Python

---

## Future Improvements

- Add input validation
- Allow user to choose image file dynamically
- Add GUI interface
- Support batch resizing
